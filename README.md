# Wordleverse

A bunch of LoLdle-style Wordle clones for video games that somehow don't have (a proper) one yet.

## To-do List

- More generalized internal API for multiple sets of answers (e.g. hard mode)
- Sharing results as emoji grid
- Saving current progress in `localStorage`
- Better looking scroll bars
